Procedure:

Step-1: Download diptrace trial version

Note: You need to download 30 days trial version as we have 500 pins in schematic. (And also you won't need it after 2-3 days.. because you guyz are software people)
 
Step-2: Open "Final_PCB_Schematic.dch". 

Note: for header pin number refer "Pin_layout.docx". (This information should be adequate). I have given each module name in schematic. 

Ask me if you don't get it.. we can also discuss it on slack.

If you guyz find any mistake in connection 
 
first step : Check again may be you got confused.
Second step : Open "Fault.docx" and write it in that.

Do not try to be oversmart and do not do any changes in "Final_PCB_Schematic.dch".

Thank you for your time. (Anyways after all you will be benifited by this - A grade in this subject).
